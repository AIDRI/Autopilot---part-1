# Autopilot---part-1
A simple CNN to drive on a road
*****************************************************************
This project is simple enough to highlight the use of CNN. The program allows you to give an angle of the road, so that you can turn the steering wheel with this angle, which would happen in real life, if you implemented the program on a real or virtual car.
