# Autopilot---part-1
A simple CNN to drive on a road
*****************************************************************
This project is simple enough to highlight the use of CNN. The program allows you to give an angle of the road, so that you can turn the steering wheel with this angle, which would happen in real life, if you implemented the program on a real or virtual car.

## How to use

1 - Personally, I use python 3.6

2 - Run [requirements.txt](https://github.com/AIDRI/Autopilot---part-1/blob/master/requirements.txt)

3 - Download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PZWa6H0i1PCH9zuYcIh5Ouk_p-9Gh58B/view). the official github page of the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/SullyChen/driving-datasets). Finally, extract your dataset on your path. Be sure the file data.txt is in your dataset folder. It is very important to create future pickle files.

4 - Run [loaddata.py](https://github.com/AIDRI/Self-driving-car-p1/blob/master/loaddata.py) with the command __py loadata.py__.

5 - Run [creata_and_train_model.py]() with the command __py create_and_train_model_py__.

6 - Run [drive_auto.py]() with the command __py drive_auto.py__.
